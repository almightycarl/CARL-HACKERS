   matcha ice or 抹茶アイスクリーム) is ice
   cream that has been blended with

   Granulated sugar – to sweeten it all 
   up! Egg yolks – egg yolk helps with 
   the stability of the ice cream and 
   works as an emulsifier. Matcha 
   powder – we use ceremonial grade 
   matcha because we love its bright 
   green color.

  The ideal flavor of this refreshing 
  treat should be a perfect balance of 
  earthy, sweet, and slightly bitter. 
  Because matcha is much more 
  concentrated than regular green tea, 
  you often don't need much to 
  experience its robust profile.

  Matcha dates back nearly a thousand 
  years to a time when dynasties ruled 
  China and Shogun clans ruled Japan. 
  This is the history of matcha. The 
  origins of matcha can be traced all 
  the way back to the Tang Dynasty in 
  China. The Tang Dynasty spanned the 
  7th – 10th centuries.

  Matcha has a bright, vegetal, and 
  slightly bitter taste, with notes of 
  sweetness and umami. High quality 
  ceremonial grade matcha is suitable to
  drink on its own, while culinary grade
  matcha can be added to lattes, 
  smoothies, and more.
