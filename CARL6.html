  Cookies and cream ice cream generally
  mixes in crumbled chocolate sandwich 
  cookies into vanilla ice cream, though
  variations exist which might instead 
  use chocolate, coffee or mint ice 
  cream.

  Flavor-wise, this is pretty similar to
  the Most Stuf Oreo. The objective 
  appears to be more of a cookies-and
  -creme direction. But I still got 
  strong vanilla notes in the cream. 
  Pretty much any chocolate “cookie” 
  notes in the creme are lost.

  Mixing the crushed Oreo cookies with 
  vanilla created what was then called 
  Oreo Ice Cream. Eventually, the head 
  of the department became aware of the 
  creation and warned the team about 
  potential copyright violations for 
  using the name Oreo. So, the name 
  Cookies 'N Cream was coined.

  Dreyer's Cookies 'N Cream ice cream
  was better than any other cookies and 
  cream ice cream we tried. It's creamy,
  there are plenty of cookie chunks, and
  it's affordable! What's not to like? 
  And if you can't find it in your local
  grocery store, look for Edy's.

 You're smooth and personable with a
 sense of humor. You don't take much 
 seriously, but love to learn and grow 
 with whatever you're doing at the 
 moment. You're not one for following 
 trends, but you always seem cool no 
 matter the circumstance.
