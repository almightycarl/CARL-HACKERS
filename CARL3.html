 <details> <li><i style="color: orange;"> More than 350 molecules have been identified in the vapour from strawberries – and around 20 to 30 of those are important to their flavour. Unlike raspberries, there is no single molecule with a “strawberry smell”. So what we smell is a blend – these molecules together give the smell sensation we know as “strawberry”.   </li></i>
