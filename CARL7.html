 What makes Magnum. If you love Magnum, 
 you'll recognise that blissful feeling 
 when you bite into the thick smooth 
 coating of chocolate and the crack as 
 it breaks away to reveal the velvety 
 vanilla ice cream. There's a long 
 journey full of craft, love and 
 dedication that goes into creating that
 moment of pleasure.

  Even though the magnums are high in 
  calories like every other ice cream, 
  it also has a fair amount of essential

  Bottling them in magnums maintains the
  delicate notes and gives you more time
  to taste the wine as the winemaker 
  intended. Magnums are also ideal for 
  aging. The lower air-to-liquid ratio 
  lengthens the maturation process, 
  giving the flavors more time to 
  develop.
