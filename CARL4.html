  That's right! Chocolate triggers the 
  release of endorphins and serotonin in
  our bodies. In addition, a chemical 
  found in chocolate called 
  phenylethylamine, is a mild mood 
  enhancer–helping us feel happy or “in 
  love” when we eat it.

  Experts suggest eating any foods that
  contain added sugar and saturated fat,
  like ice cream, in a moderate and 
  mindful way. In excess, these foods 
  might displace nutritious choices in 
  your diet and increase the risk of 
  chronic conditions like heart disease
  high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes
  over time.

  chocolate can be both rich and light
  With its variations, it finds a way to
  be fresh with each scoop. Although
  other ice cream flavors are making a 
  run for the most popular ice cream 
  flavor spot, cookies and cream, butter
  pecan and even mint chocolate cannot 
  overtake chocolate or vanilla.
