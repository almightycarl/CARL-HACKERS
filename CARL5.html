  Vanilla ice cream is a form of 
  chilled or partially frozen desert
  that is flavored with vanilla beans,
  which are actually not beans at all 
  but the fruit seed pods of plants in
  the orchid genus Vanilla.

    Vanilla ice cream is made by
    blending in vanilla essence in along
    with the eggs (optional), cream, 
    milk and sugar. The vanilla essence 
    added gives the ice cream a very 
    natural aroma and vanilla flavour. 
    Vanilla ice cream is used in the 
    creation of other flavours, such as 
    rocky road, fruit punch and many 
    more.

  Some of the compounds found in vanilla
  extract and beans have antioxidant 
  effects, meaning they help protect 
  against cell damage. For example, two 
  of vanilla's phenolic plant components
  , vanillin and vanillic acid, have 
  been researched for their antioxidant 
  potential.
